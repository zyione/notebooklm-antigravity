Fast, but sharing the key securely is difficult.\n- **Asymmetric (Public Key):** Uses a mathematically related Public/Private key pair (e.g., RSA). Slower, but solves the key distribution problem.\n- **Hashing:** A one-way function (e.g., SHA-256) used to verify data integrity and safely store passwords."

For example, a Regex to validate a URL might look like: `^https?:\\/\\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[\\w-]+\\.)+(?:com|org|net)$`, which strictly defines the allowed characters and structure, preventing malicious payloads."
